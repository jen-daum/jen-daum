# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jen, a budding front-end developer. With a background in VBA, SQL, and Excel, and some adventures in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I'm on a journey to deepen my skills in front-end development. 
Here on GitHub, I'm looking to grow, contribute, and collaborate on cool projects.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning & Building
As I dive deeper into the world of front-end development, I'm currently focusing on expanding my understanding of React and other front-end tools. I love exploring new libraries and frameworks that make the web more interactive and accessible. 
Check out my repositories for a peek into my learning process through mini-projects and experiments.

- **[world-clock]**: A tiny project to get the time in chosen cities. Built with Java, CSS, HTML with Bootstrap.
- **[weather-app]**: my first mini-project to retrieve weather data from a chosen city. Focused on responsiveness and user interaction. Built with Java, CSS, HTML with Bootstrap.
